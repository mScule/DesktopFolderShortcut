# DesktopFolderShortcut
"shortcut" that opens up a program, and closes the folder where it's located. It's for desktop shortcuts that are inside folders.
 
## How to use:
1. Copy and paste the DesktopFolderShortcut.bat inside a folder where you want the shortcuts.  
2. Create folder called "Shortcuts" inside the same folder, and put the real shortcuts (lnk,url,etc) in there.  
3. Make copies of DesktopFolderShortcut.bat for every shortcut, and rename them as you wish.  
4. Write the desired shortcut filename inside the quotation marks at shortcutName="".  
5. Now, when you run this batch file it should open the program and close the folder that it's located in!  

*Note: in order to make this script work. It's crucial to make the Shortcuts folder for the shortcuts!*

## Why tho:
I have many folders on my desktop that I use to store shortcuts. I got annoyed how the folders still stayed open after launching programs so I wrote this fewliner to help me with this problem. I think it works without any problems so I thought it would be cool to share :) Im not batch scripting professional tho so I don't know is there some downsides to this.
