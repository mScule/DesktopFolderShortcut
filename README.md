# DesktopFolderShortcuts.
Have you ever stored program shortcuts in folders on desktop? Have you also noticed how tedious it is to close all the different folders after you have opened some of those programs? This is the reason why I wrote this little script that creates "shortcuts" that also closes the file explorer at the same time as you open up some of these programs!

*Note: in order to make this script work. It's crucial that you do the following:"*

*- File explorer -> select "view" -> select "Change folder and search options".*
*- Folder options -> select "view".* 
*- Check "Display the full path in the title bar".*
*- Check "Launch folder windows in a separate process."*
*- You are done!*

## How to use:
1. Copy "CreateShortcuts.bat" to the folder that contains the shortcuts, and execute the "CreateShortcuts.bat" file.  
2. The batch file creates folder for the shortcuts inside the folder and creates a bat file for every shortcut.
3. Click one of these shortcuts to open the desired program and the explorer will close up also!
4. If you want to add more shortcuts, just drag the new ones in to the folder that contains the "CreateShortcuts.bat" and run it again.
